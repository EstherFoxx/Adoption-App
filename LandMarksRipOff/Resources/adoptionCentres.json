Please seek other alternatives.\n If you are in a position where you no longer want your pet due to a change in circumstances do not assume it can be 'deposited' at the shelter. We encourage all owners to explore alternatives such as rehoming with family or friends or temporarily getting the pet boarded for a short while. Never ever just put the animal out on the street to fend for itself. \n If you are left with NO other option but to seek rehoming then please contact us at our email address with all necessary details including your full contact details and we will put a posting out on your behalf. Animal lovers consider pet abandonment as serious an issue as animals that are physically abused as this is mental abuse for the pet who doesnt understand why they are being given up.\n 2) Visiting: Please let us know in advance if you are planning on visiting the shelter so we can advise the volunteers. \n We prefer visitors not just to turn up as it can affect the animals so please notify us in advance through email as without that we may not be able to allow you in the shelter.",

Mercylight was incorporated in January 2015 as a non-profit organization with the aim to promote compassion for animals through the provision of animal welfare services and prevention of cruelty to animals. In May 2020, we were conferred the charity status and is now known as Mercylight Animal Rescue And Sanctuary Limited.\nWe obtained the Institution of Public Character (IPC) status on 24 January 2022. Thiswas a great milestone for MARS. With strong financial controlsand processes in place, we achieved IPC Status in 18 months fromCharity Status.\nTo date we have over 100 committed people volunteering as kennel volunteers, stray feeders, packers, fosterers and sponsors.\nAnimal rescue work is obviously not an easy task. There are about 7,000 stray dogs out there suffering from hunger, thirst, harsh weather conditions and unkind treatment. We are part of the nationwide initiative launched in November 2018, known as the Trap-Neuter-Release-Manage (TNRM) programme with the aim of sterilising more than 70 per cent of the stray dog population over five years.\n According to AVA, approximately 15,000 to 20,000 cats and dogs are put down yearly in Singapore because the shelters are full and there is no place to house the impounded animals.

In Pali language, “metta” means loving kindness and also refers to the special bond shared between humans and animals. \n Established in 1999, the sanctuary started with 50 cats and now houses more than 200 rescued cats and dogs. Many of the residents lived a harsh existence on the streets before Mdm Lee took them in. Rain or shine, Mdm Lee, her son Terry, and the occasional hired help take care of the residents every day. For the animals, Metta Cats and Dogs Sanctuary is the only home that they have ever known. Metta is also one of the rare no-kill shelters in Singapore.\n Since Mdm Lee’s demise in 2019, Terry has taken over and operated the sanctuary single-handedly, with the assistance of a team of volunteers. Metta has to raise about $24,000 every month to keep the sanctuary going. This amount excludes the high cost of medical care as and when the animals need treatment. Currently, the sanctuary relies fully on donations and fundraising events to survive.",

Choosing to donate to our pet shelter is one way you can help; you can donate money or items and we even have a wish list of things that we need to keep the shelter running on a continual basis.

Animal Lovers League, currently a registered no-kill shelter, became official in 2002 to legitimately garner sufficient support in our quest to control the stray population by sterilisation and not annihilation.\nAs one of the largest and longest serving animal welfare group in Singapore, ALL constantly needs the support of the public to help keep the charity running and continue caring for the animals. Some of the ways members of the public can help include, giving monetary contributions and monthly pledges, donating food for the cats and dogs and taking care of the animals.\nEveryday, we hear pleas to save or rescue a life. We however, persist in rehoming and sheltering all those who seek refuge with us though the journey is a challenging and onerous one. We advocate adoption over buying.\nPlease stay with Animal Lovers League, walk with us, feel with us and continue to support so that we can continue helping our shelter creatures as well as our over 500 stray dogs and cats. These are daunting numbers, but we continue to strive for the sake of our animals, giving each and every one of them a voice.",

        "description": "In 2015, Chained Dog Awareness Singapore was started. The non-profit organisation was founded to raise awareness of the plight of the many dogs chained across Singapore. We believe in upholding the Five Domains of Animal Welfare, a new model proposed by Professor David Mellor and Dr Cam Reid in 1994, as a means of systematically identifying and grading the severity of different forms of welfare compromise by reformulating the Five Freedoms as ‘Five Domains’ of nutrition, environment, health, behaviour and mental state.\nChaining dogs is contrary to these Five Domains and is one of the most inhumane punishments that a social animal like a dog can endure. Dogs chained and caged for prolonged periods of time are denied the opportunity to engage in everyday activities that promote physical and emotional health. These dogs will eventually suffer from being isolated, consistently alone, intense boredom, frustration, depression and sadness. An otherwise friendly and docile dog, when kept continuously chained or intensively confined in any way, becomes neurotic, unhappy, anxious and often aggressive.\nWe believe that man's best friend should not be permanently chained by their owners. Every year we advocate for 30-40 chained dogs, some rescued with AVS or other animal rescue organizations, while others surrendered by their owners.",
